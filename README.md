# What's that?
A simple script meant to unstuck players who are stuck together.
This is a redesign of the AntiPlayerStuck script.
The features are the same, but the code has been fully rewritten.

# Why should I use this script on my server rather than the original?
After a quick benchmark, it turns out that my detection function is almost 15 times faster than in the original script, and is executed at least 10 times less often, making it (very) faster.
By switching to this script, you'll be doing your server's CPU a favor.
